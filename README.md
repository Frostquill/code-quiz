-WHEN I answer a question incorrectly

-THEN time is subtracted from the clock

-WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were all used in and combined product of a quiz, multiple javascript functions were added with added methods to change the DOM to allow a more interactive experience. HTML and CSS were added for a foundational point for JS to augment.
